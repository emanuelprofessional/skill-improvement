Devops Day 1: Creation of a user with a non-interactive shell

	1. We aim to create an account on the system without a user being able to log into the server
	2. Security best practice for service accounts (web servers, databases, automated backup script) that need to own files or run background processes but without direct terminal access
	3. The user cant ssh, cli login, and gui login with those credentials
	4. The admin can run the application in the name of a user with the user not able to do so himself/herself 
	4. Steps:
		1. ssh to the server where the user will be created (ssh user@server)
		2. create the user account with non-interactive shell (sudo useradd -s /sbin/nologin [username])
		3. verify the user's shell configuration in "/etc/passwd" file (grep [username] /etc/passwd) (id [username])
